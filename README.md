The topic I picked was world development indexes to see whether factors such as GDP or carbon dioxide emissions were correlated. More broadly, I wanted to find out whether these factors could suggest any economic, social, or climate trends. Looking if factors such as education expenditure or population of a country had an affect on its GDP and how carbon dioxide emissions and forest area correlated. To approach this, I created multiple linear regression models and various different graphs to see whether we could find any correlations. With these tools, I can see if there are correlation within the several variables such as carbon dioxide emissions and population or education expenditure and GDP per capita.
